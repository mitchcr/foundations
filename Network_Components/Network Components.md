  > **Note:** In an Azure VM environment, additional specific routes are often configured to facilitate communication with Azure services and resources. Here are the explanations for the additional specific routes:
  >> - Route to 168.63.129.16: This route is used for communication with the Azure DHCP server and other Azure infrastructure services. The IP address 168.63.129.16 is a well-known Azure internal IP address used for various platform services. [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/what-is-ip-address-168-63-129-16)
  >> - Route to 169.254.169.254: This route is used for communication with the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS). The IP address 169.254.169.254 is a link-local address used by Azure VMs to retrieve metadata about the VM, such as its configuration, network settings, and other information.

### Scenario 4 : Disabling networking from cloud-init
#### Overview Lab 10 Scenario 4

- Disable cloud-init networking module
- Replace the Network Interface assigned to lab10sles
- Fix broken network on the VM lab10sles

#### Instructions Lab 10 Scenario 4

Step 1: Connecting to the VM lab10ubuntu
- Connect to the VM created in the previous scenario and switch to root account
  ``` bash
  sudo -i 
  ```

Step 2: Disable networking management in cloud-init
- Create an additional configuration file for cloud-init which it will disable the networking management.
  ```bash
  echo "network: {config: disabled}" | sudo tee /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
  ```

  </details> 

Step 3: Verify the change
- Check the contents of the configuration file to ensure the networking management is disabled:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
  ```

     <summary>Screenshot: Start the VM back</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image27.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 8: Connect to the VM using the serial console
- Find the "Serial Console" option and connect using the user and password defined during the deployment of the system

     <summary>Screenshot: Connect back to the VM using the Serial Console</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image28.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 9: Check current NIC hardware address
- Check the MAC for the NIC on the system and compare against the one configured on the netplan yaml file created previosuly by cloud-init
  ``` bash
  sudo -i
  ip a sh 
  cat /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
  ```
  > **Note:** Compare both definitions. The MAC address assigned to the system is different from the one configured in Netplan. As a result, the network has not been configured correctly on the system, and no IP address or routes were configured

     <summary>Screenshot: Return the the network management to cloud-init</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image29.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 10: Restore the cloud-init network manangement
- Removing the configuration file created on the Step 2. Optionally the MAC can be updated with the correct new value on /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
  ``` bash
  cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg # Check the content of the file
  rm /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg # Remove the file 
  reboot # Reboot the system
  ```
Step 11: Connect to the VM
- Using ssh, connect to the VM, check the MAC for the NIC on the system and compare against the one configured on the netplan yaml file created previosuly by cloud-init
  ``` bash
  sudo -i
  ip a sh 
  cat /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
  ```
  > **Note:** Compare both definitions. This time both MAC definitions will match and an IP address has been assigned to the interface

### Scenario 5 : Setting custom DNS and Domain
#### Overview Lab 10 Scenario 5

- Form the Azure Portal, change DNS and Domain

#### Instructions Lab 10 Scenario 5

Step 1: Connecting to the VM lab10sles
- Connect to the VM created in the previous scenario lab10sles and switch to root account
  ``` bash
  sudo -i 
  ```
Step 2: Changing to a custom DNS on the vnet from the Azure Portal
- Locate the VM lab10sles, find the "Network settings" and click on the Virtual Network created

  <details>
     <summary>Screenshot: Finding the VNET</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image32.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 3: Add DNS IP addresses to the VNET
- Once the VNET information is loaded, look for "DNS servers", click on "Custom" and add as DNS servers these dummy values ```1.2.3.4``` and ```2.3.4.5```. Click on Save

  > **Note:** These are not real DNS servers! Restart the VM from the Azure Portal

  <details>
     <summary>Screenshot: Changing the DNS on the VNET</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image33.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 4: Checking the DNS servers change
- Connect one more time to the VM. As root check the ```/etc/resolv.conf```. The new DNS servers should be already defined
  ``` bash
  sudo -i
  cat /etc/resolv.conf # Check the DNS configuration settings for the system.
  ```
  <details>
     <summary>Screenshot: Check the resolv.conf</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image34.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 5: Setting custom search domains
- As showed in the previous step, the default search domain is ```reddog.microsoft.com```. Change this to ```microsoft.com```
  ``` bash
  echo NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST="microsoft.com" >> /etc/sysconfig/network/config # Appends to the file setting a static DNS search list to include microsoft.com
  systemctl restart wicked.service # Restart wicked.service to apply any changes made to the network configuration on SLES
  cat /etc/resolv.conf # Check the DNS configuration settings for the system.
  ```
  <details>
     <summary>Screenshot: Change the search domain and check the resolv.conf</summary>

### Scenario 6 : Check connection for a webserver
#### Overview Lab 10 Scenario 6

- Check the status of a port using ```ss```/```netstat```
- Check SELinux configuration for a port
- Check firewalld configuration for a port
- Execute a packet capture of the web traffic using ```tcpdump```

#### Instructions Lab 10 Scenario 6

Step 1: Connecting to the VM lab10rhel
- Connect to the VM created in the previous scenario and switch to root account
  ``` bash
  sudo -i 
  ```

Step 2: Check the apache webserver is running
- Check the systemd unit for httpd and for the network sockets for port 80
  ``` bash
  systemctl -l --no-pager status httpd # Displays the detailed status of the httpd service without truncating the output or using a pager.
  ss -tuln | grep :80 # Lists all listening TCP and UDP sockets and filters the results to show only those using port 80.
  netstat -tuln | grep :80 #  Lists all listening TCP and UDP sockets and filters the results to show only those using port 80.
  ```

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image36.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 3: Check SELinux
- SELinux can block the traffic to port 80. Make sure the status of SELinux and the rules
  ``` bash
  sestatus # Displays the current status of SELinux on the system.
  semanage port -l | grep http_port_t # Lists all SELinux port contexts and filters the results to show only those associated with the http_port_t type.
  ```

     <summary>Screenshot: Check the webserver is running and binding the correct port</summary>

	<img src="./.attachments/lab10image37.png" alt="Check for updates." size=950x>
  </details> 

Step 4: Check firewalld
- On Enterprise Server based linux distribution firewalld is used to handle the internal firewall. Make sure its status and the rules on the system
  ```bash
  firewall-cmd --state # Displays the current state of the firewalld service.
  firewall-cmd --list-all # Displays all the current settings and configurations of the firewalld service.
  ```

  </details> 

Step 5: Capturing Traffic for Port 80 Using tcpdump
- Capture traffic on port 80. Access the VM public IP from a webbrowser, once the test is done, hit ```Ctrl-C``` to stop the capture
  ``` bash
  tcpdump -i any port 80 and not host 168.63.129.16 # Captures network traffic on port 80 from all interfaces while excluding traffic from the IP address 168.63.129.16 which could be sending health probes to the VM.
  ```

  </details> 

  > **Note:** The parameter ```-w``` can be used to save the capture in a pcap file
  ``` bash
   tcpdump -w mycapture.pcap -i any port 80 and not host 168.63.129.16
  ```
